# Home-Automation
IoT Home Automation using Blynk and NodeMCUESP8266 enables you to control and monitor home devices remotely through 
a mobile app. Blynk provides a user-friendly interface for creating IoT applications, while NodeMCU ESP8266 is a 
programmable microcontroller board. By connecting the NodeMCU to your Wi-Fi network and programming it, you can 
automate tasks like controlling lights, adjusting temperature, and monitoring environmental conditions. The 
Blynk app serves as the control center, allowing you to interact with your devices from anywhere. You design the 
user interface in the app by adding widgets that correspond to different device .
